# Multifunctional Discord Bot

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a discord bot that can perform several useful functions for a discord server including kicking/banning members from the server, displaying a member's avatar upon request, replying to specific messages such as "hello" and "bye" (ensures the member doesn't feel lonely in the moment), setting member nicknames upon request, playing games like rock paper scissors with a user, organizing a game of tic tac toe for members, and sending funny attachments in response to a specific message. My discord bot also checks to see if a member who wants to kick/ban another member from the server has the required permissions to do so. It also handles cases like when the requested user to be kicked/banned is not in the server or when the bot itself does not have the required permissions to kick/ban a member or set a member's nickname.
